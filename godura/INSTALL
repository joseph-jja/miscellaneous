This file describes how to install this software and should be read!

For RPM machines like Redhat:
--------------------------------------

To install and use rpm safely I recommend the following: 

1) Untar the godura-0.6.1.tar.gz file as follows:

tar -zxvf godura-0.6.1.tar.gz

2) Edit the spec files and change the builddir to point to the dir that you 
plan to build the rpm in. In most cases this is /var/tmp. I prefer to use a 
safer method of doing so and build them in my home dir, thus preventing 
mucking up my system. The install.sh script is an attempt at doing this.

3) Then move or copy the tar to SOURCES directory that you wish to install 
into.

4) Then run rpm:

rpm -ba godura.spec

or 

rpm -bb godura.spec

5) Then you can rpm -i ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/i386/godura-0.6.1.tar.gz

YOU INSTALLED!

** if only all rpms were this easy ;-)

For machines that do not use redhat package management (rpm?):
--------------------------------------

1) tar -zxvf godura-0.6.1.tar.gz

2) then cd godura-0.6.1

3) ./configure 
NOTE: only a few options are supported and it has not been fully tested.
Use --prefix=<where you want the prefix to be> to change this
Default is /usr/local

4) make

5) make install 

** It installs the godura executable in /usr/local/bin
