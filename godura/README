This program is called Godura. It is modeled after my program Tk NotePad,
which was modeled after windows notepad. Tk NotePad is a basic text editor 
like windows Notepad, with a few enhancements, like Search - Replace, 
and unlimited (well virtually unlimited) Undo / Redo.
Tk NotePad may have a few quirks, but there are no real bugs.  The current 
issues with Tk NotePad are believed to be inherent in Tcl/Tk.

Godura uses the gtk+/glib 2+ widget set and C.

So far not much is implemented. 
	1) The File menu works, but has no Print. This is stil in testing.
	2) Edit works.
	3) memory leaks ???
	4) seems to have built in drag and drop between godura instances.
	5) line numbering seems to work, but not for mouse actions, and some other things.
