Changes:

Dec 16-17, 2000
Created checkPass subroutine and updatePass routines. Made all files call
checkPass to make sure that a user submitted a correct username and password.

Updated admin_cfg.cgi, apcupsd_conf.cgi, apcconf.cgi, and apcupsd_pwd.cgi 
to call these subs.

Also added apcupsd_common.pl which contains the checkPass and updatePass subs.

Modified the Makefile so that you specify where perl is and it edits all 
the perl files for you rather than hand editing all the files.

Also modified the Makefile to optionally install the password file.

Updated README.


April 29, 2000
Fixes and cleanups in the admin_cfg.cgi program.

General cleaning up of the code so that the reset button now works.

After submitting the data the uname / pwd && confirm pwd are now cleared

Checking and changes to the pwd file are now done after pwd / uid verification of the admin user.


April 23, 2000
Lots of changes. apccomments was changed to perl and integrated into apcconf.cgi.
 
I believe I fixed a bug in the handling of the slaves directive. It should handle  multiple slaves 
adding and deleting with no problems.

Mar 4, 2000

Fixed apcreadconf so that if it cannot open the config file it does not print the error
message 20 times.

Comments are now peserverd through the use of apccomments which now writes only 
the modified parts of the file.

Modified the listboxes giving them a width=30.

Comes with 3 different config files. One for server, one for slave and one for the default.
These are read on only.  They reside in the cfgfiles directory.
