        <DT>NETSERVER [on | off] 
        </DT><DD>
        This configuration directive turns the network information server on
        or off. If it is on, <b>apcupsd</b> will spawn a child process that serves
        STATUS and EVENTS information over the network. This information is
        currently used by the Web based CGI programs. The default is on. In
        some cases, for added security, you may want to invoke a separate
        information server daemon from the inetd daemon. In that case,
	<B>NETSERVER</B> should be <B>off</B>. 
        </DD><DT>
		<a name="SERVERPORT"></a>
        SERVERPORT &lt;port&gt; 
        </DT><DD>
        This configuration directive specifies the port to be used by the
        <B>apcupsd</B> Network Information Server. The default is 7000. If you change this port,
        you must manually change the #define SERV_TCP_PORT in cgi/upsfetch.c
        and rebuild the CGI programs.

		<a name="EVENTSFILE"></a>
        EVENTSFILE &lt;filename&gt; 
        </DT><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">
        If you want the <b>apcupsd</b> network information server to provide the
        last 10 events via the network, you must specify a file where
        <b>apcupsd</b> will save these events. The default is:
        <B>/etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.events</B>. Currently, <b>apcupsd</b> will save at
        most the last 50 events. Periodically (once an hour by default),
		<b>apcupsd</b> will check the size of this file. 
		When more than 50 events are recorded, <b>apcupsd</b> will
        truncate the file to the most recent 10 events. Consequently this
        file will not grow indefinitely. Although we do not recommend
		it, you may change these values by editing apcevents.c and changing
		the appropriate defines. Be aware that if you set these values to 
		very large numbers, <b>apcupsd</b> may make excessive memory demands
		on the system during the data access and file truncation operations.

        </DT><DD>
	Specify the time in seconds between messages requesting logged in
	users to get off the system during a power failure. This timer
	starts only when the UPS is running on batteries. The default is 300
	seconds (5 minutes).

		<a name="DELAY"></a>
		<a name="ANNOYDELAY"></a>
        DELAY&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;time in seconds&gt; 
        </DT><DD>
	Specify delay time in seconds before <b>apcupsd</b> begins requesting
	logged in users to get off the system during a power failure. This
	timer starts only after the UPS is running on batteries. This timer
	is reset when the power returns. The default is 60 seconds. Thus,
	the first warning to log off the system occurs after 60 seconds on
	batteries.

        Based on Ten (10) percent of a setting. This allows one to define
        the point when the /etc/nologin file is created. Once the /etc/nologin
		file is created, normal users are prevented from logging in. 
		Control of when this file is created is important for
        allowing systems with BIG UPSes to run as normally until the system
        administrator determines the need for preventing user logins. The feature
        also allows the system administrator to hold the &quot;ANNOY&quot;
        factor until the /etc/nologin file is created. The default is <b>disable</b>.
        </DD><DL>
                <DT>

        If BATTERYLEVEL is specified, during a power failure, <b>apcupsd</b> will
        halt the system when the remaining battery charge falls below the

        </DT><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">
        After a power failure, <b>apcupsd</b> will halt the system when TIMEOUT seconds
        have expired. A value of zero disables this timer.
		Normally for SMARTUPSes, this should be zero so that
        the shutdown time will be determined by the battery level and/or
        remaining runtime (see above). This command is useful for dumb UPSes
        that do not report battery level or the remaining runtime. It is
        also useful for testing <b>apcupsd</b> because you can force a rapid
        shutdown by setting a small value (e.g. 60) and pulling the plug to
        the UPS. 
        </DD><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">

Configuration Directives Used to Set the UPS EPROM</H3>
<P>The values specified with the following directives are only used
if the <B>--configure</B> option is specified on the <b>apcupsd</b> command
line, and the UPS is capable of internal EPROM programming. In that
case, <b>apcupsd</b> attempts to set the values into the UPSes EPROM. 
</P>
<P>Under normal operations, the values for these parameters specified
in the configuration file are not used. Instead, they are read from
the UPS EPROM by <b>apcupsd</b>. See the <a href="eprom.html">EEPROM programming section</a>
of this manual for further details.

        This value determine how sensitive the UPS is to the mains quality
        and voltage fluctuations. The more sensitive it is, the quicker the
        UPS will switch to battery power when the mains line quality is bad.
        Normally, this should be set to H, but if you find your UPS
        switching to batteries frequently, you might want to try a less
        sensitive setting, providing that your computer equipment tolerates
        the poor quality mains. This value is written to the UPS EPROM when
        the &nbsp;&nbsp;configure option is specified.

        The UPS power restart delay value in [0,60,180,300] in seconds after the
        UPS has shut down during a power failure. This is to prevent the power
        from coming back on too quickly after a power down, and is important
        for those who have high rpm drives that need to spindown before
        powering them up again. Some older SCSI models are very sensitive to
        this problem. Default is zero. This value is written to the UPS
        EPROM when the --configure option is specified. Under normal apcupsd

		<a name="NETTIME"></a>
        NETTIME &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;time in seconds&gt;

        The interval in seconds that the master uses to broadcast information to slave machines.

		This port number is used only in the master/slave networking code. Note

		<p>A different port number for the Network Information Server is specified 
		with the <b>SERVERPORT</b> configuration directive.

		<a name="MASTER"></a>
        MASTER&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;name of master&gt; for Slave machine. 
        </DT><DD>
        Used in slave configuration files, this is the network name of the 
		master which is authorized to send commands to this slave. In all
		cases (of which I am aware), when you specify a <b>MASTER</b> directive,
		you will also specify <b>UPSCABLE ether</b> since your information
		about the UPS will come via the network from a master. 
		<p>The slave
		machine will be shutdown whichever occurs first: either at the request of the master when
		it does a shutdown or when the values you have specified for TIMEOUT,
		BATTERYLEVEL, or MINUTES expire (these should work but have not been fully
		tested). Consequently, if you want the slaves to begin shutting down before
		the master, you can do so by adjusting the values in the configuration file.
		If you want the slave to remain up until the master shuts down, you should set
		TIMEOUT, BATTERYLEVEL, and MINUTES all to zero.
		<p>For proper functioning of the slave, you must specify the
		same <b>UPSTYPE</b> in the slave configuration file as is in
		the master configuration file.
		<p>It should be noted that the master and slaves continue to communicate
		over the network even after the master has issued a shutdown command
		to the slaves. This is because the master <b>apcupsd</b> continues
		to run until it receives the shutdown signal from the system. This is
		important to ensure that all the slaves have been properly notified of
		the shutdown.
		<p>We recommend that the machine names used on the <b>MASTER</b> and <b>SLAVE</b>
		directives be put in your <b>/etc/hosts</b> file so that <b>apcupsd</b> will
		be able to resolve the machine name during startup and shutdown even if
		DNS is not running.
        </DD><DT>
		<a name="SLAVE"></a>
        SLAVE&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;name of slave(s)&gt; for Master machine. 
        </DT><DD>
        Used in master configuration files, this is the name of a slave 
		machine that depends on this master. There can be
        a maximum of 20 slaves attached to one master. Thus you can specify
		multiple SLAVE directives in a master configuration file.
		<p>As noted above the master and slaves continue to communicate
		over the network even after the master has issued a shutdown command
		to the slaves. This is because the master <b>apcupsd</b> continues
		to run until it receives the shutdown signal from the system. This is
		important to ensure that all the slaves have been properly notified of
		the shutdown.
		<p>We recommend that the machine names used on the <b>MASTER</b> and <b>SLAVE</b>

		<a name="USERMAGIC"></a>
        USERMAGIC&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; user defined magic&gt; for Slave machine.
                </DT><DD STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">
	    The USERMAGIC directive specifies a second level of identification
		security in a slave configuration file. It is a character string
		up to 17 characters in length. It should be unique for each slave.
		When the slave makes initial contact with the master, this string
		is passed to the master. Then on each transmission from the master
		to the slave, the string is passed back to the slave, which checks
		that it is the correct string before accepting the master's information.
	    This string should be different for each and every slave on the network.
