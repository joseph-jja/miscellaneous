
There are a lot of bugs in this application now. Not sure why.  
This seems to have occured at the time of the switch to the java mail api's 
from my own custom beans.  I'll have to look into this as to see what it is
that I am doing wrong and also probably update the mail.jar files.

1) Logon fails and then on reload works.  
	- fixed, this problme occurs when you have BOTH 
	pop3.jar and mail.jar in the classpath 

2) Need to add sessionid to urls so that cookies are not needed.
<filename>.jsp;jsessionid=session.getId()? needs to be the 
default base URLS

3) Application should connect once and then maintain that state.
